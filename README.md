## Day 1 ⭐⭐ - Python has a function for that
----  

### Part 1

```
Split the file into two lists,
Sort the lists
Zip the lists
Total the absolute difference
```

### Part 2
```
Itereate through every element in List 1
If its not in list two; 0 * x = 0, therefore it can be skipped
Multiply the value from the hashmap with key "Element" by element
Sum this number
```

## Day 3 ⭐⭐ - REGEX v1
---

### Part 1
```
Regex find all mult matches r"mult\(\d{1,3},\d{1,3}\)"
Iterate through matches, total the integer product
```

### Part 2
```
Allow regex to search for do() and don't()
Iterate through doing the same; except if do() or don't() is found, update a boolean value
If this value is False; do not total the product.
```
